	abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) heralds a new era of computing whereby every imaginable object is equipped with, or connected to a smart device allowing data collection and communication through the Internet. The IoT challenges individual privacy in terms of the collection and use of individuals' personal data. This study assesses the extent to which the Australian Privacy Principles protect individual privacy associated with data collection through the IoT. A systematic literature review identified four key privacy themes that represent issues related to the collection of individuals' data through the IoT: unauthorised surveillance, uncontrolled data generation and use, inadequate authentication and information security risks. These four themes are used to critically analyse the Australian Privacy Principle's (APPs) protection of individual data. Findings indicate that (1) the APPs do not adequately protect individual privacy of data collected through the IoT, and (2) future privacy legislation must consider the implications of global reach of IoT services, and ubiquity and security of IoT data collection with respect to individual privacy.},

In some cases, they can be used as a tool for committing serious crimes. Although some researchers have already explored such issues in the IoT domain and provided solutions for them, there remains the need for a thorough analysis of the challenges, solutions, and open problems in this domain. In this paper, we consider this research gap and provide a systematic analysis of security issues of IoT-based systems. Then, we discuss certain existing research projects to resolve the security issues. Finally, we highlight a set of open problems and provide a detailed description for each. We posit that our systematic approach for understanding the nature and challenges in IoT security will motivate researchers to addressing and solving these problems.},

	abstract={XML is rapidly emerging as a standard for data representation and exchange over the World Wide Web and an increasing amount of sensitive business data is processed in XML format. Therefore, it is critical to have control mechanisms to restrict a user to access only the parts of XML documents that she is authorized to access. In this paper, we propose the first DTD-based access control model that employs graph matching to analyze if an input query is fully acceptable, fully rejectable, or partially acceptable. In this way, there will be no further security overhead for the processing of fully acceptable and rejectable queries. For partially acceptable queries, we propose a graph-matching based authorization model for an optimized rewriting procedure in which a recursive query (query with descendant axis ‘//’) will be rewritten into an equivalent recursive one if possible and into a non-recursive one only if necessary, resulting queries that can fully take advantage of structural join based query optimization techniques. Moreover, we propose an index structure for XML element types to speed up the query rewriting procedure, a facility that is potentially useful for applications with large DTDs. Our performance study results showed that our algorithms armed with rewriting indexes are promising.},

In this context, developing an access control mechanism in terms of XML is an important step for Web information security. In this paper, we present the protection and administration facilities of Author-X, a Java-based system for discretionary access control to XML documents. Relevant features of Author-X are both a set-oriented and a document-oriented credential-based document protection, a differentiated protection of document/document type contents through the support of multi-granularity protection objects and positive/negative authorizations, and the support for different access control strategies. In this paper, we focus on the strategies we have developed for enforcing access control. Additionally, we provide a description of the environment we have developed to help the Security Officer in performing administrative activities related to both security policy and subject credential management.

	abstract={The Web is becoming the main information dissemination means in private and public organizations. As a consequence, several applications at both internet and intranet level need mechanisms to support a selective access to data available over the Web. In this context, developing an access control model, and related mechanisms, in terms of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is an important step, because XML is increasingly used as the language for representing information exchanged over the Web. In this paper, we propose access control policies and an associated model for XML documents, addressing peculiar protection requirements posed by XML. A first requirement is that varying protection granularity levels should be supported to guarantee a differentiated protection of document contents. A second requirement arises from the fact that XML documents do not always conform to a predefined document type. To cope with these requirements, the proposed model supports varying protection granularity levels, ranging from a set of documents, to a single document or specific document portion(s). Moreover, it allows the Security Administrator to choose different policies for documents not covered or only partially covered by the existing access control policies for document types. An access control mechanism for the enforcement of the proposed model is finally described.},

To enable configuration without a large amount of administrators’ effort, we introduce capabilities to egress NAC. In our method, a user can transfer his/her access rights (capabilities) to other persons without asking administrators. To realize our method, we use a DNS cache server and a router. A resolver of the client sends the user name, domain name, and service name to the DNS cache server. The DNS server issues capabilities according to a policy and sends them to the client. The client puts these capabilities into the IP options of packets and sends them to the router. The router verifies the capabilities, and determines whether to pass or block the packets. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of our method in detail. Experimental results show that our method does not reduce the router's performance. "},

	abstract = 	 {Since the 1970s, computer systems have featured multiple applications and served multiple users, leading to heightened awareness of data security issues. System administrators and software developers focused on different kinds of access control to ensure that only authorized users were given access to certain data or resources. One kind of access control that emerged is role-based access control (RBAC). A role is chiefly a semantic construct forming the basis of access control policy. With RBAC, system administrators create roles according to the job functions performed in a company or organization, grant permissions (access authorization) to those roles, and then assign users to the roles on the basis of their specific job responsibilities and qualifications. A role can represent specific task competency, such as that of a physician or a pharmacist. Or it can embody the authority and responsibility of, say, a project supervisor. Roles define both the specific individuals allowed to access resources and the extent to which resources are accessed. For example, an operator role might access all computer resources but not change access permissions; a security-officer role might change permissions but have no access to resources; and an auditor role might access only audit trails. Roles are used for system administration in such network operating systems as Novell's NetWare and Microsoft's Windows NT. This article explains why RBAC is receiving renewed attention as a method of security administration and review, describes a framework of four reference models the authors have developed to better understand RBAC and categorize different implementations, and discusses the use of RBAC to manage itself. The authors' framework separates the administration of RBAC from its access control functions.},

With IoT infrastructure, physical objects such as wearable objects, television, refrigerator, smart phones, supply-chain items and any objects across the globe would get connected using the Internet. Sensing, radio waves, mobile technology, embedded systems and Internet technology are promising actors which play significant roles in IoT infrastructure. Security and privacy issues in IoT scenarios would be much more challenging than what is been used in the conventional wireless scenarios. In particular, the constrained environments require lightweight primitives, secure design and effective integration into other environments in order to see IoT in its desired shape. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy challenges in IoT scenarios and applications with special emphasis on resource-constrained environments’ security objectives and privacy requirement. We provide different perspectives of IoT, discuss about important driving forces of IoT, and propose a generic construction of secure protocol suitable for constrained environments with respect to IoT scenarios and applications.},

	abstract = 	 {For companies and government agencies alike, the emergence of Web services technologies and the evolution of distributed systems toward service oriented architectures (SOA) have helped promote collaboration and information sharing by breaking down "stove-piped" systems and connecting them via loosely coupled, interoperable system-to-system interfaces. Such architectures, however, also bring about their own security challenges that require due consideration. Unfortunately, the current information security mechanisms are insufficient to address these challenges. In particular, the access control models today are mostly static and coarsely grained; they are not well-suited for the service-oriented environments where information access is dynamic and ad-hoc in nature. This paper outlines the access control challenges for Web services and SOA, and proposes an attribute based access control (ABAC) model as a new approach, which is based on subject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. The paper describes the ABAC model in terms of its authorization architecture and policy formulation, and makes a detailed comparison between ABAC and traditional role-based models, which clearly shows the advantages of ABAC. The paper then describes how this new model can be applied to securing Web service invocations, with an implementation based on standard protocols and open-source tools. The paper concludes with a summary of the ABAC model's benefits and some future directions.},

Therefore in order to obtain security in the access control,suitable approaches must be designed. Since the most important way in implementing SOA is the use of web services, in this article we proposed an architecture for web services in access control to protected services and to adopt some policies on the applications based on ABAC model and SAML standard and XACML languages. The possible activity in the architecture and the implementation stages are explained using use case diagram and sequence diagram in UML.},

Controlling access in Web services environment is crucial and a significant challenge because this environment is more dynamic and heterogeneous. Compared with the existing models, attribute-based access control is more appropriate for Web services, but it do not fully exploit the semantic power and reasoning capabilities of emerging web applications. To address these issues, a semantic and attribute-based access control framework (S_ABAC) is presented by combining the attribute-based access control with semantic-based access control in this paper. By extending the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language architecture and representing semantically the resources and users attributes with ontology, S_ABAC can realize semantic and attribute-based access control, and can also provide administratively scalable alternative and semantic interoperability. In the prototype implementation, S_ABAC uses Shibboleth service to address the disclosure issue of the sensitive attributes and also separates ontology management from access management.},

They are used in our homes, in hospitals, deployed outside to control and report the changes in environment, prevent fires, and many more beneficial functionality. However, all those benefits can come of huge risks of privacy loss and security issues. To secure the IoT devices, many research works have been conducted to countermeasure those problems and find a better way to eliminate those risks, or at least minimize their effects on the user’s privacy and security requirements. The survey consists of four segments. The first segment will explore the most relevant limitations of IoT devices and their solutions. The second one will present the classification of IoT attacks. The next segment will focus on the mechanisms and architectures for authentication and access control. The last segment will analyze the security issues in different layers.},

	abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) promises major role in terms of medium and information transaction, management computing, and security from the beginning of the 21st century. IoT plays an important role in daily life. Routing in IoT is the serious problem because existing routing is not designed to meet current demands in the Internet. Today routing is a continuous strain in terms of the number of threats, performance, security, reliability and scalability. Routing is a fundamental mechanism in communication network and its security is critical to ensure availability and to prevent attacks. Developing and expanding secure routing mechanism is still a challenge in IoT. This paper presents various routing techniques towards IoT. Furthermore, explain the routing process because in which information is exchanged with the help of the routers. This paper also explains the different types of attack modelling. Attacks are possible in routing because of minimum security in IoT, the attacker attacks the routing process to misuse of data. Some attacks are diverting traffic to an attacker controlled router, i.e. route-hijacking and denial of service attacks exploiting routing mechanism.},

	abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a concept where the barriers between the real world and the cyber-world are progressively annihilated through the inclusion of everyday physical objects combined with an ability to provide smart services. These services are creating more opportunities but at the same time bringing new challenges in particular security and privacy concerns. To address this issue, an access control management system must be implemented. This work introduces a new access control framework for IoT environment, precisely the Web of Things (WoT) approach, called “SmartOrBAC” Based on the OrBAC model. SmartOrBAC puts the context aware concern in a first position and deals with the constrained resources environment complexity. To achieve these goals, a list of detailed IoT security requirements and needs is drawn up in order to establish the guidelines of the “SmartOrBAC”. Then, The OrBAC model is analyzed and extended, regarding these requirements, to specify local as well as collaboration access control rules; on the other hand, these security policies are enforced by applying web services mechanisms mainly the RESTFUL approach. Finaly the most important works that emphasize access control in IoT environment are discussed.},

	abstract = 	 {Web service is a new service-oriented computing paradigm which poses the unique security challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, multi-domain characteristic and highly dynamic nature. A key challenge in Web services security is the design of effective access control schemes. However, most current access control systems base authorization decisions on subject's identity. Administrative scalability and control granularity are serious problems in those systems, and they are not fit for Web services environment. So an attribute-based access control model (WS-ABAC) is presented to address these issues in this paper. WS-ABAC grants access to services based on attributes of the related entities, and uses automated trust negotiation mechanism to address the disclosure issue of the sensitive attributes. It can provide administratively scalable alternative to identity-based authorization methods and provide fine-grained access control for Web services. Moreover, it also can protect user's privacy},

	abstract={The increasing interest in applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the widespread use of efficient but limited operating systems like Contiki OS. Applications running on constrained devices in the IoT should only be able to access those resources which are specified by the user. While on mobile platforms such as the Google Android and the Apple iOS various access control mechanisms are in use, on IoT platforms such as Contiki OS this is not yet provided. In this paper, we explain a number of existing approaches in the mobile ecosystem and mention the research challenges for applying those approaches to one of the well-known operating systems in the IoT ecosystem, i.e., Contiki OS. The main problem is that operating systems for constrained devices in the IoT are quite limited and do not provide any memory protection or virtualization support. As the main contribution, we propose our novel approach for providing fine-grained access controls in Contiki OS under these constraints.},

Compared with the existing models, the Action-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is the most suitable to control the access on Web services. In this paper, the ABAC model is introduced. Then, the security architecture of ABAC for Web services is proposed. In the architecture, the Action server manages the action information, the Domain server determines the security rank of request resources, and the Resource server storing the resources with different security ranks responses the request from the user. The cookie is extended with security properties.},
